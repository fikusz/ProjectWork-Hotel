# ProjectWork-Hotel
This is my share of the Projectwork we made with my classmates during our Progmasters Automata Tester course.
Docker is implemented in the workflow.
The project includes: 

- Selenium Registration tests
- POM (Page OBJECT MODEL)
- Automatic Importing into Jira
- ALLURE
- The start of implementing CI/CD into the project


test_bee_allure_registration.py Is meant to run with allure, it is slower, because it has to open new browser for each test case, but gives the allure report.
test_bee_registration.py Runs the code faster, and gives back text in case an assertion fails.
